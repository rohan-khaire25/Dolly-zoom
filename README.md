# Dolly-zoom

### What is Dolly Zoom ###
Dolly Zoom is an effect used by filmmakers to create a sensation of vertigo, a “falling-away-from-oneself feeling”. It keeps the size of an object of interests constant in the image, while making the foreground and background objects appear larger or smaller by adjusting focal length and moving the camera.

### Objectives ###
Given 3D coordinates of vertices. compute focal length that finds focal length such that the height of the object A remains constant while the camera moves along with Z axis. The reference depth, reference focal length and height of the object A and the camera movement will be given.
